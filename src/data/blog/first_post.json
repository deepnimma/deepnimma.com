    "Hello everybody and welcome to the first post in my blog!!! Woohoo!!",
    "It took such a long time to make this thing function. Essentially, because I didn't really want to learn how to create a sort of 'generator' in javascript, I made a python script that autogenerates the blog pages just the way I like them. This is the equivalent to using hammer to screw in a screw because I did not want to learn how to use a screwdriver. Anyways, I hate javascript so I do not consider this a waste of my time and any hour spent NOT learning Javascript is an hour well spent in my opinion.",
    "Anyways, enjoy these cute cats."
